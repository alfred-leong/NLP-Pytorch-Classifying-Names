# Character-Level RNN Classification - PyTorch Tutorial

This repository follows the [Character-Level RNN Classification Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html) from the official PyTorch documentation. The tutorial demonstrates how to build and train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for classifying words into languages at the character level.

## Overview

The goal of this tutorial is to implement a character-level RNN that takes in a sequence of characters from a word and predicts the language it belongs to. This serves as an introduction to RNNs, providing insights into how they can handle sequential data and learn patterns at the character level.
